# About HTX Property Management

## Our Story

Our texas real estate licensed small business was founded by two engineers who have lived in Houston for over 15 years. What started with managing our own property naturally expanded into helping friends manage, buy, sell, and maintain theirs. These experiences shaped our expertise and gave us a clear understanding of what property owners truly need. 

Our journey began with a simple mission: to provide property owners with professional, reliable management services that maximize their investment returns while minimizing their stress. Today, we continue to uphold that mission while leveraging modern technology and industry best practices.
